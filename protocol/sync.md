# 6. Synchronization

As a decentralized protocol, Degas' Leader nodes transmit user data to Follower nodes within the network. This data serves as the base for Degas to perform further data and state validation.

Similar to blockchain, Leader nodes organize data into Blocks. Each Block contains data sent by users to the network, including RPC requests and Messages. Follower nodes can synchronize this data from either Leader nodes or other Follower nodes.
